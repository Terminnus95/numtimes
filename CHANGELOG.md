# Changelog
This file contains a list of all the versions of this program, and a list of things I would like to add next

## 1.1
- Added a new argument (--answer-only), when passed, this argument will only print out the result of every multiplication instead of printing the result among with the operation

## 1.0
- Initial release

## Ideas
- Add color printing and an argument to enable/disable it
- Make it posible to output the result to a simple text file
- Make it availible as a library so people con use it in their projects
